# Intuition and Explanation for Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II

## Problem Overview

Given a binary circular array `nums`, the goal is to find the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1's together at any location within the array. The array is circular, meaning that the first and last elements are considered adjacent.

For example, given the array `nums = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]`, we want to group all the 1's together. One possible arrangement is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`, which requires one swap. Another valid arrangement is `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`, also requiring one swap. The minimum number of swaps needed is 1.

## Approach

1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - We can use a sliding window of size equal to the number of 1's in the array. This window will move through the circular array.
   - Initially, we count the number of 1's in the first window.
   - As we slide the window, we update the count by subtracting the outgoing element (if it's 1) and adding the incoming element (if it's 1).
   - The goal is to minimize the number of 0's within this window.

2. **Observations**:
   - The minimum number of swaps needed corresponds to the minimum number of 0's within the window.
   - If we know the initial count of 0's within the window, we can update it efficiently as the window slides.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize variables:
     - `window_size`: Number of 1's in the array (size of the sliding window).
     - `zero_count`: Count of 0's within the initial window.
     - `min_zero_count`: Initialize with `zero_count`.
   - Extend the array by duplicating it (to handle circular property).
   - Iterate through the extended array:
     - Update `zero_count` based on the elements entering and leaving the window.
     - Update `min_zero_count` with the minimum encountered `zero_count`.
   - The final `min_zero_count` represents the minimum swaps needed.

## Dry Run Examples

### Example 1:

Input: `nums = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]`

1. Initial window: `[0, 1, 0]` (1 zero)
2. Slide window to `[1, 0, 1]` (still 1 zero)
3. Slide window to `[0, 1, 1]` (now 0 zeros)
4. Slide window to `[1, 1, 0]` (still 0 zeros)
5. Slide window to `[1, 0, 0]` (1 zero)
6. Slide window to `[0, 0, 1]` (1 zero)
7. Slide window to `[0, 1, 0]` (1 zero)

Minimum swaps needed: 1

### Example 2:

Input: `nums = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]`

1. Initial window: `[0, 1, 1]` (1 zero)
2. Slide window to `[1, 1, 1]` (0 zeros)
3. Slide window to `[1, 1, 0]` (1 zero)
4. Slide window to `[1, 0, 0]` (2 zeros)
5. Slide window to `[0, 0, 1]` (2 zeros)
6. Slide window to `[0, 1, 1]` (1 zero)
7. Slide window to `[1, 1, 0]` (1 zero)
8. Slide window to `[1, 0, 0]` (2 zeros)

Minimum swaps needed: 2

### Example 3:

Input: `nums = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]`

Since all 1's are already grouped together due to the circular property, no swaps are needed.

Minimum swaps needed: 0
