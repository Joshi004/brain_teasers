## Intuition and Approach

To determine if you can make the array `arr` equal to the array `target` by reversing any number of subarrays, you need to verify if both arrays contain the same elements with the same frequencies. 

**Intuition:**
- If `arr` can be transformed into `target` by reversing subarrays, then both arrays must contain exactly the same elements with the same counts. Reversing subarrays does not change the element frequencies or types, so we can determine if transformation is possible by simply checking if both arrays are permutations of each other.

**Approach:**
1. **Count Frequencies:** Create frequency counts for both `target` and `arr` arrays using dictionaries. Each dictionary will map elements to their counts in the respective array.
2. **Compare Dictionaries:** Compare the two dictionaries. If they are equal, then `arr` can be transformed into `target` by reversing subarrays; otherwise, it cannot.

**Steps:**
1. Create a dictionary to count the frequency of each element in the `target` array.
2. Create a dictionary to count the frequency of each element in the `arr` array.
3. Compare the two dictionaries. If they are equal, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

## Dry Run

### Test Case 1

- **Input:**
  - `target = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - `arr = [2, 4, 1, 3]`

- **Execution:**
  - Count frequencies in `target`:
    ```python
    target_counter = {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}
    ```
  - Count frequencies in `arr`:
    ```python
    arr_counter = {2: 1, 4: 1, 1: 1, 3: 1}
    ```
  - Compare dictionaries:
    ```python
    target_counter == arr_counter  # True
    ```
  - **Output:** `True`

### Test Case 2

- **Input:**
  - `target = [7]`
  - `arr = [7]`

- **Execution:**
  - Count frequencies in `target`:
    ```python
    target_counter = {7: 1}
    ```
  - Count frequencies in `arr`:
    ```python
    arr_counter = {7: 1}
    ```
  - Compare dictionaries:
    ```python
    target_counter == arr_counter  # True
    ```
  - **Output:** `True`

### Test Case 3

- **Input:**
  - `target = [3, 7, 9]`
  - `arr = [3, 7, 11]`

- **Execution:**
  - Count frequencies in `target`:
    ```python
    target_counter = {3: 1, 7: 1, 9: 1}
    ```
  - Count frequencies in `arr`:
    ```python
    arr_counter = {3: 1, 7: 1, 11: 1}
    ```
  - Compare dictionaries:
    ```python
    target_counter == arr_counter  # False
    ```
  - **Output:** `False`
