## Explanation and Approach

The goal is to minimize the height of a bookshelf when placing books of varying thickness and height on shelves of a fixed width. You want to find the optimal way to arrange the books such that the total height of the bookshelf is minimized.

### Intuition

1. **Recursive Placement**: The problem can be approached by recursively deciding where to place each book:
   - **On a New Shelf**: Consider placing the current book on a new shelf, which would involve adding the height of the current shelf to the height of the bookshelf for the remaining books.
   - **On the Same Shelf**: If the book fits on the current shelf, consider placing it there and update the height of the shelf accordingly.

2. **Memoization**: To avoid recalculating the same scenarios, use memoization. Store the results of previously computed states (combinations of book index and available shelf width) to speed up the process.

### Approach

1. **Recursive Function**: Define a recursive function `get_height(i, available_width, shelf_max, mem)` where:
   - `i` is the index of the current book.
   - `available_width` is the remaining width on the current shelf.
   - `shelf_max` is the maximum height of the current shelf.
   - `mem` is a memoization dictionary to store results for each state.

2. **Base Case**: If all books are processed (`i` equals the length of books), return the total height of the current shelf.

3. **Recursive Cases**:
   - **Placing on a New Shelf**: Compute the height if the current book is placed on a new shelf, adding the height of the current shelf to the result of processing the remaining books.
   - **Placing on the Same Shelf**: If the book fits on the current shelf, update the maximum height of the shelf and compute the height for the remaining books.

4. **Memoization**: Use the dictionary `mem` to store and retrieve results of previously computed states to avoid redundant calculations.

5. **Initialization**: Start the recursion with the first book, the full shelf width, and an initial shelf height of 0.

### Dry Run

#### Example 1

**Input:**
- Books: `[[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]]`
- Shelf Width: `4`

**Execution:**

1. **Start with Book 0**:
   - **Available Width**: 4
   - **Current Shelf Height**: 0

2. **Case 1: Place Book 0 on a New Shelf**:
   - **New Shelf Height**: `0 + height of shelf = 1`
   - **Available Width for New Shelf**: 4
   - **Recursive Call**: `get_height(1, 4, 1, mem)`

3. **Continue with Book 1**:
   - **Available Width**: 4
   - **Shelf Height**: 1
   - **Book 1 Width**: 2, **Height**: 3

   **Subcase: Place Book 1 on the Same Shelf**:
   - **New Available Width**: 2
   - **New Shelf Height**: `max(1, 3) = 3`
   - **Recursive Call**: `get_height(2, 2, 3, mem)`

4. **Continue with Book 2**:
   - **Available Width**: 2
   - **Shelf Height**: 3
   - **Book 2 Width**: 2, **Height**: 3

   **Subcase: Place Book 2 on the Same Shelf**:
   - **New Available Width**: 0
   - **New Shelf Height**: `max(3, 3) = 3`
   - **Recursive Call**: `get_height(3, 4, 3, mem)`

5. **Continue with Book 3**:
   - **Available Width**: 4
   - **Shelf Height**: 3
   - **Book 3 Width**: 1, **Height**: 1

   **Subcase: Place Book 3 on the Same Shelf**:
   - **New Available Width**: 3
   - **New Shelf Height**: `max(3, 1) = 3`
   - **Recursive Call**: `get_height(4, 3, 3, mem)`

6. **Continue similarly with Books 4, 5, and 6**:
   - By recursively computing the height for each book, while considering both placement options (new shelf or same shelf), you will find the minimum possible height.

**Final Result**: After all recursive calls are resolved and memoized results are used, the minimum possible height for the bookshelf is computed.

#### Example 2

**Input:**
- Books: `[[1,3],[2,4],[3,2]]`
- Shelf Width: `6`

**Execution:**

1. **Start with Book 0**:
   - **Available Width**: 6
   - **Current Shelf Height**: 0

2. **Case 1: Place Book 0 on a New Shelf**:
   - **New Shelf Height**: `0 + height of shelf = 3`
   - **Available Width for New Shelf**: 6
   - **Recursive Call**: `get_height(1, 6, 3, mem)`

3. **Continue with Book 1**:
   - **Available Width**: 6
   - **Shelf Height**: 3
   - **Book 1 Width**: 2, **Height**: 4

   **Subcase: Place Book 1 on the Same Shelf**:
   - **New Available Width**: 4
   - **New Shelf Height**: `max(3, 4) = 4`
   - **Recursive Call**: `get_height(2, 4, 4, mem)`

4. **Continue with Book 2**:
   - **Available Width**: 4
   - **Shelf Height**: 4
   - **Book 2 Width**: 3, **Height**: 2

   **Subcase: Place Book 2 on the Same Shelf**:
   - **New Available Width**: 1
   - **New Shelf Height**: `max(4, 2) = 4`
   - **Recursive Call**: `get_height(3, 1, 4, mem)`

**Final Result**: After all recursive calls are resolved and memoized results are used, the minimum possible height for the bookshelf is computed.
