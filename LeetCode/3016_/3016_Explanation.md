## Explanation of the Code

### Intuition and Approach

The goal is to minimize the number of key presses required to type a given word by remapping the letters to the keys on a telephone keypad. Here’s the step-by-step thought process to solve the problem:

1. **Understanding Keypad Mechanics**:
   - Each key (from 2 to 9) can be pressed up to three times to type different letters. For example, the key 2 might initially map to "a", "b", and "c". Pressing it once types "a", twice types "b", and three times types "c".

2. **Counting Letter Frequencies**:
   - We need to determine how often each letter appears in the given word. This is because the more frequently a letter appears, the fewer key presses it should require.

3. **Sorting by Frequency**:
   - To minimize key presses, we should prioritize the most frequent letters. Therefore, we sort the letters by their frequency in descending order.

4. **Assigning Letters to Keys**:
   - We have 8 keys (2-9), each capable of handling up to 3 letters, making a total of 24 slots. 
   - Assign the most frequent letters to the first press of each key, the next most frequent to the second press, and so on. This way, the most frequent letters require the fewest presses.

5. **Calculating Total Key Presses**:
   - For each letter, calculate the total number of key presses based on its frequency and the number of presses needed to type it. Sum these values to get the total number of key presses for the entire word.


### Dry Run

Let’s dry run the code with the example `word = "aabbccddeeffgghhiiiiii"`:

1. **Frequency Counting**:
   - Count the frequency of each letter:
     ```
     {
       'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2, 'd': 2, 'e': 2, 'f': 2, 
       'g': 2, 'h': 2, 'i': 6
     }
     ```

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort letters by frequency in descending order:
     ```
     [('i', 6), ('a', 2), ('b', 2), ('c', 2), ('d', 2), 
      ('e', 2), ('f', 2), ('g', 2), ('h', 2)]
     ```

3. **Assignment and Calculation**:
   - Assign the most frequent letters to the keys:
     ```
     i -> 1st press on key 2
     a -> 1st press on key 3
     b -> 1st press on key 4
     c -> 1st press on key 5
     d -> 1st press on key 6
     e -> 1st press on key 7
     f -> 1st press on key 8
     g -> 1st press on key 9
     h -> 2nd press on key 9
     ```

   - Calculate the total presses:
     ```
     Total presses = 6*1 + 2*1 + 2*1 + 2*1 + 2*1 + 2*1 + 2*1 + 2*1 + 2*2
                   = 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4
                   = 24
     ```

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Counting the frequency of each letter takes \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is the length of the word.
  - Sorting the letters by frequency takes \(O(26 \log 26)\) time, which simplifies to \(O(1)\) since there are at most 26 letters.
  - The final loop to calculate the total presses takes \(O(26)\) time, which is also \(O(1)\).

  Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n)\).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - Storing the frequency of each letter takes \(O(26)\) space, which is \(O(1)\).
  - The sorted list of letters also takes \(O(26)\) space, which is \(O(1)\).

  Overall, the space complexity is \(O(1)\).
